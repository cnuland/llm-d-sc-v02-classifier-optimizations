    A risk-coverage curve must rise as coverage falls: dropping the least
    confident traffic should leave a cleaner remainder. When it does not, the
    confidence ordering is inverted somewhere in the top of the range and every
    threshold read off that curve is meaningless.

    This is invisible to accuracy. The gate that motivated this control scored
    88.41% against a folded alternative's 88.95% -- a wash -- while its curve
    peaked at 60% coverage and FELL to 91.57% at 30%, worse than keeping 70%. It
    could not reach 97% at any coverage; the alternative reached 99% by escalating
    38%. Nothing in accuracy, macro-F1 or ECE distinguished them.

    The usual cause is a saturated head: a 2-class softmax on a hard boundary has
    one logit difference to express both which side and how sure, and it compresses
    the confident half into a band too narrow to rank. That is reported separately,
    because a curve can still be monotone while having no resolution left to
    threshold on -- and the fix differs (train on a finer taxonomy and fold, rather
